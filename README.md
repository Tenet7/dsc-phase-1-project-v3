# Phase 1 Project 


## Overview

The company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. I am tasked with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. 

## Business Understanding

The company is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises.
The company lacks actionable insights that can help decide which aircraft to purchase. Below are key business questions that I used to solve and understand the problem.
*Finding the aircraft model with the least number of accidents
*Know the number of flights the aircraft makes
*Finding out the severity of the accidents
*It is up to you to decide what data to use, how to deal with missing values, how to aggregate the data, and how to visualize it in an interactive dashboard.

## Business Understanding and Analysis

The source of the data that we'll be using in this project is from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters, in the folder called `data` in [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)

* **This analysis will yield three concrete business recommendations.** The key idea behind dealing with missing values, aggregating and visualizing data is to help your organization make data driven decisions. 

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of the aviation division) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).






## Summary
This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
